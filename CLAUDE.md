## Claude-Specific

This file extends AGENTS.md with Claude Code capabilities.
All rules in AGENTS.md apply. This file adds only what's specific
to Claude Code's features.

### Permissions

Agent permissions are defined in `.claude/settings.local.json`.
For npm operations (publish, version), ask the user — these require authentication.
