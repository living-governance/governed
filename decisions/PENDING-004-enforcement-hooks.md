# Enforcement Hooks

## Question
Should constitutional enforcement be deterministic (pre-commit hooks / CI blocks) rather than advisory (conditions read at session start)?

## Context
- Shankar: "CLAUDE.md is should-do. Hooks are must-do."
- Craddock: Spec Kit injects constitutional constraints into templates automatically
- CIO (Jyoti): "agents authenticate against constitution before interacting"
- Our enforcement table lists conditions but nothing blocks violations today

## Options
To be determined after first component is shipped and violation patterns emerge.
