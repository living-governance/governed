# New Component Creation Workflow

## Question
What is the standard workflow for creating a new component from scratch?

## Context
- Only one component exists so far (framework-coverage)
- Second component (threat-intelligence aggregator) is next
- CLAUDE.md currently says "work with the user interactively"
- Pattern will become clear after the second component is built
- Define after threat-intelligence component is complete

## Options
To be determined from experience building the second component.
